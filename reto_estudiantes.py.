STEPS:
1. Create a Python program to evaluate online purchases.
2. Ask the user to enter the purchase amount and if it is greater than $100 add a 10%. 
3. Ask the user for an applied discount.
4. Ask the user if they have a membership card if yes, then all an extra 5% discount. 
5. Remember to explain to the user why they are receiving their corresponding discounts.
