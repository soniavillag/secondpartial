Code for the organization of the study 
STEPS:
  1. Make the function to get the name of the subject and the time the person will dedicate to it 
  2. Ask the user the number of subjects that they are taking
  3. Create two lists (one for the times and one for the names) for each subject 
  4. Create a for loop to ask the user for the subject and store it in my two lists 
  5. Display the result using a for loop, which will print 
"""

def subject(): #This function asks for the name and time 
  name = input("Please tell me the name of the subject: ")
  time = int(input("How many hours will you dedicate to that subject?: "))
  time_minutes = time * 60
  time_day = time_minutes / 5
  return name, time_day 
number_subjects = int(input("How many subjects do you have?: "))
names = [] #I am creating an empty list to store the results of the names the user enters
times = [] #Same as the last, but now for the times

  names.append(name)
  times.append(time)
